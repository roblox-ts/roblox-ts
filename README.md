## Why?
As Roblox games become increasingly complex and larger in scope, efficiently writing safe code becomes challenging with Lua. In addition, Lua is difficult to make tooling for.

**roblox-ts** is designed to solve these problems by compiling TypeScript code directly into Lua, tuned for use in Roblox specifically.

## How?
**roblox-ts** is an attempt to bridge the abilities of TypeScript to work in a Roblox environment. We break down your code into an abstract syntax tree (via [ts-morph](https://github.com/dsherret/ts-morph)) and emit functionally similar structures in Lua so that the code behaves the same (minus the type information).
