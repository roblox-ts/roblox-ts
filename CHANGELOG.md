### **0.3.0**
- Truthiness Rework: Truthiness is now evaluated like in TypeScript/JavaScript. `0`, `""`, and `NaN` are now falsy.
	- Added compiler option `--logTruthyChanges`, which displays all code affected by the truthiness change.
- Fixed `&&`/`||` expressions which now respect the control flow of expressions which require multiple statements in Lua
- Fixed behavior for when libraries require a different version of a package other than the one globally installed in a project
- Fixed #586 - `new ReadonlySet()` and `new ReadonlyMap()` now work
- Fixed #604 - `rbxtsc --init package` now fills out package.json better
- Fix issues relating to method vs callback logic, specifically, making `this` work better as a first parameter. This should improve object composability. See https://git.io/fjxRS
- Converted almost all of our bitwise operators to bit32
- Fixed our system of checking whether something is a type vs a value.
- Fixed importing system for when your project requires a package version other than the globally installed one.
- Added macro variable `PKG_VERSION` which gets replaced with the "version" string in your package.json file on compile
